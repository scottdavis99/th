James Burke:

The behavior you saw stems from two things: 

1) It looks like you added bootstrap to a project that is an AMD-based 
project (which is the default for a "volo create" call -- the default 
project is set up for AMD. So for scripts that are not already AMD or 
CommonJS-style modules, it prompts the user to set the dependencies 
and exports. 

However, for something like bootstrap that has lots of files, it is a 
bit of overkill. You can manually avoid it by doing "volo add --amdoff 
bootstrap". I'm also considering changing this behavior to just doing 
one prompt up front that describes what will happen, or just turn it 
off. 

2) The zip file is pulled from the github source for that tag, where 
it looks like the release they have on their website: 
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/bootstrap.zip 

is a built version of that source. The idea though behind a volo add 
is that so you can get the project, particularly the JS modules, in 
subcomponents and then only build in what you need. 

However if most people wanted the full built sources, we could put in 
a volo.url package.json shim that points to the above zip file instead 
pulling the code from source. For me though, I would want the separate 
components. If you like, volo should be able to fetch that URL 
directly for installation.
