            <h2>Consulting Projects</h2>

            <p>Sometimes <a href="training.html">training</a> your team of developers in a new technology stack is sufficient to roll out a new project. Other times, you'd like more sustained help. ThirstyHead offers architectural / leadership consulting services that include software development, agile / process improvements, technology reviews, and more.</p>

            <p>Many of the projects ThirstyHead help with are internal corporate applications that live "behind the firewall". Here's a representative sample of the public-facing projects we've helped release:</p>

                        When Ames Construction was awarded the contract to <a href="http://36commutingsolutions.org/us-36-projects/u-s-36-express-lanes-project/">expand the US 36 highway corridor</a> between Denver and Boulder (Colorado), part of the project included providing a mobile app for the general public.

                        This app shows you traffic congestion at a glance (via a green/yellow/red status bar). It offers a fully interactive Google Map with live traffic cameras. It sends out notices for construction updates and lane closures. It also provides information about driving alternatives, including bike lanes and bus routes.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        ThirstyHead designed the look and feel of the app, selected the technology stack (HTML5 to reach the broadest number of mobile phones), built and delivered the app as a turn-key solution, and continues to host the application.

                      ThirstyHead was brought in early to help build a prototype for industry trade shows. Based on the success of the prototype, our team was invited back to help build the final product in conjunction with in-house development teams. 
                    </p>                 

                    <p>
                      We worked closely with the design team to help with look and feel issues, as well as streamlining the UX. We provided Backbone expertise to integrate the client-side HTML5 with internal and external web services, including streaming video in a variety of formats. We also helped set up the testing infrastructure to "mock out" cable set-top box behavior during the early stages of the development process.

                      Learning Sciences International (LSI) has a successful web application called <a title="iObservation" href="http://www.iobservation.com/">iObservation</a>. This app allows an "observer" (typically a principal or school administrator) to evaluate a teacher's classroom performance and teaching style and offer suggestions for improvement based on industry-leading experts' advice.
                    </p>  

                    <p>
                      LSI originally wrote iObservation in .NET. They contacted ThirstyHead to help port the app to Grails. Along the way, we also identified infrastructure inefficiencies and helped them adopt agile development methodologies as they quadrupled their development staff.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Due to sporadic network connectivity and a wide variety of target devices (laptops and tablets using a diverse set of operating systems and web browsers), iObservation heavily leverages HTML5 and various polyfill techniques to provide comparable functionality across all platforms. Local storage, HTML5 video, and rich UI components for rapid data entry are all keys to the success of iObservation.

                      TriMet provides bus, light rail and commuter rail transit services in the Portland, Oregon metro area. They are innovative in the services that they offer to the general public, as well as their commitment to open source and open standards-based software.
                    </p>  

                    <p>
                      After Scott Davis gave a presentation at <a href="http://goscon.org/">GOSCON</a> (a government open source software conference), TriMet approached ThirstyHead for help transitioning their infrastructure from a largely commercial / proprietary technology stack to one based on open source and open standards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      ThirstyHead provided an architectural roadmap that offered one-for-one open source alternatives to their existing commercial components. We helped their internal development team stand up a set of standards-based, reusable web services. We helped them transition to weekly iterations / software deliveries to help demonstrate regular progress to project stakeholders.
